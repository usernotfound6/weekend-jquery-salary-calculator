Jquery Salary Calc

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

We created a salary calc that took in the employees info and added their combined salaries. i had issues ranging from minor things like finding out how to clear the submit field to figuring out how to add the sum of the salaries and appending it to the footer. I was able to solve these issues by asking fellow students and researching online for syntax, solutions and methods.
